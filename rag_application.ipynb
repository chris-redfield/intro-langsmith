      "R: To implement user feedback mechanisms in LangSmith, you can manually annotate traces with feedback directly within the application, allowing users to add comments or notes about specific issues. Additionally, you can set up feedback criteria as continuous or categorical feedback, enabling structured input from users. This feedback can then be associated with any intermediate run of the trace, facilitating targeted improvements in trace quality.\n",

For traces that need to be retained beyond the maximum data retention period of 400 days, consider adding them to a dataset, which allows for indefinite storage. Additionally, ensure compliance with data privacy regulations by setting appropriate retention periods for traces.\n",

      "R: To implement role-based access control (RBAC) in LangSmith, first ensure you have the Enterprise plan, as RBAC is only available to Enterprise customers. Next, navigate to the Roles tab in the Members and roles section of the Organization settings page to create custom roles if the default roles (Admin, Viewer, Editor) do not meet your needs. Finally, assign these roles to users by going to the Workspace members tab in the Workspaces section of the Organization settings page.\n",

      "Q: How do I create a feedback form in Langsmith to gather user input on trace usability and functionality?\n",
      "R: To create a feedback form in LangSmith, you can set up feedback criteria as feedback tags within your workspace. You can choose between continuous feedback, where you define a range of acceptable scores, or categorical feedback, where you can create specific tags for user input. Once the criteria are established, users can provide feedback on traces, which can be logged and analyzed for usability and functionality.\n",
